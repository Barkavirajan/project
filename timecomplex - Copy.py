It occurs when the array is already sorted 
Average Case Complexity: O(n2)
It occurs when the elements of the array are in jumbled order (neither ascending nor descending).

Stability:
Selection sort is not a stable sorting algorithm. Stability means that when two elements have equal keys, their relative order is preserved in the sorted output. In selection sort, the relative order of equal elements may change, making it an unstable sorting algorithm.

Quicksort Time Complexity:
Best-case: O(n log n)
Average-case: O(n log n)
